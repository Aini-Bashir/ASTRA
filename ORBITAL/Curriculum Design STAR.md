# CURRICULUM DESIGN STAR

To create a curriculum for *AST STUDY PROGRAM*, We should first determine the overall goals and objectives of the program. Once we are clear with understanding of what we want the program to achieve,i.e to provide learning with interest to the students, To make a curriculum that can be taught online in different ways like making 100 reels for each topic/chapter and after every topic and chapter a quiz which will be marked by XPs *(Xpression Points)*. We need to identify the specific knowledge, skills, and competencies that students will need to acquire in AST Program in order to meet those goals/ achieving a degree or skill set.

Next, The AST Program Team need to organize the curriculum into logical units or modules that build on one another, and that align with the program's overall goals and objectives. It's also important to consider the sequencing of the curriculum, and to ensure that more advanced topics are covered after students have mastered the foundational knowledge and skills.

The AST Program Team will also be considering the types of assessments that will be used to evaluate student progress and performance, and to ensure that they align with the program's goals and objectives.

Finally, The Team will be reviewing the curriculum regularly and make adjustments as needed, based on feedback from students, faculty, and industry professionals.

* Discussed about how to assess students using the Focus Grading System Sheet and possibly apply the Grading Sheet used for dancing and it needs editing (if we're going to use this grading sheet).

* The image shows how the spreadsheet and the powerpoint slide are connected. Since it is in the blossoming phase then the process in the powerpoint slide is going upward.

* Since it is making roots then the process in the powerpoint slide is going downwards. It shows how it is connected to the spreadsheet.

TASK / QUESTIONS:

1. Figure out how to grade inside the Focus Grading System.

2. Questions to ask students in the assessment area of the Focus Grading System.

3. Are we going to use the Dance grading system and edit the tasks accordingly? And the grade of these tasks goes to the Focus Grading System?

4. Research how to create and how to grade the curriculum.
5. Research if we're going to use the traditional grading system or if we can find something that's innovative and has been applied already? Maybe find something on GitHub Classroom for example.

Hello! How can I assist you today?

For our H3 training program is it normal to spend a year on the analysis of the training program or is it more common for companies to quickly put a training program together with a more basic program outline and syllabus. I'm just trying to gage of how much time and how many resources we should put towards the creation of the coursework before we submit the paperwork to the US CIS. Try to help us gage how many people, how much time,, and what our expectation should be for our corporation to build a qualified H 3 training program. We already have a handbook for our company that has about 15 links in it of different online courses that we tell people to go to. Onsite, and our US Office, we also have a professor who has taught internationally at multiple universities and multiple high schools.

Creating a qualified H-3 training program requires careful planning and adherence to specific guidelines set forth by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The time and resources needed can vary significantly depending on the complexity of your program, but here are some general considerations:

Review & Approval Phase:

Duration: 1-2 months.
Activities: Internal review by stakeholders, revisions based on feedback.

Resources
Personnel Involved
